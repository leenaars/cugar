# CUGAR

This project aims to develop and implement a (Wireless) Access Point and a back-end for it using only Open Source software components.

The Access Point (AP) together with the back-end makes secure environment for Closed User Group Services. This allows a secure connection between AP and the back-end when using a non-secure transport medium (like the Internet).

The whole system is being developed as an "appliance" and a back-end software package. AP itself will be implemented on small embedded systems in order to ease the deployment. The back-end (authentication, management, routing) can run on a generic UNIX system.
